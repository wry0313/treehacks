The Stable Matching Problem is analyzed using proof techniques to find a solution that matches jobs and candidates based on their preferences.

The Propose-and-Reject algorithm (Gale-Shapley algorithm) is introduced as a simple, fast, and widely-used method to achieve stable matchings.

The algorithm operates in discrete time "days," with jobs proposing to candidates and candidates either accepting ("maybe") or rejecting offers until no offers are rejected.

The algorithm's termination results in stable matchings, where no pair would benefit from switching partners.

Stability is defined as a key property, ensuring no job and candidate pair would prefer each other over their current matches.

Analysis proves the algorithm always halts and produces stable matchings, leveraging the Improvement Lemma and well-ordering principle.

The concept of optimality is explored, distinguishing between job/employer optimal and candidate optimal matchings, demonstrating the algorithm's job/employer optimality.

Historical context is provided, including the use of the algorithm in the Residency Match program for medical graduates and hospitals, highlighting its real-world impact.

The note discusses the implications of algorithm design on institutional structures and outcomes, reflecting on power dynamics and institutional changes in the National Residency Matching Program.

Key Generation:

Choose two large prime numbers p and q. Compute N = pq, which serves as the modulus for both the public and private keys. The size of N dictates the security of the system, with larger values being more secure but also slower to compute. Calculate φ(N) = (p-1)(q-1), which is used in determining the public and private keys. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(N) and e is coprime to φ(N), making e the public key exponent. Determine d as the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo φ(N), meaning d is the private key exponent satisfying the equation de ≡ 1 (mod φ(N)).
Encryption:

The sender, Alice, takes the recipient's public key (N, e) and the message M, which has been converted into an integer m in the range 0 < m < N. Alice computes the ciphertext c using the equation c ≡ m^e (mod N).

Decryption: The recipient, Bob, uses his private key d to compute m ≡ c^d (mod N). Since m is the original message, Bob successfully retrieves M from m.

Security: The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring the large number N back into its prime components p and q. Without the knowledge of p and q, an attacker cannot compute the private key d from the public key (N, e). RSA's encryption and decryption work because of the mathematical property that (m^e)^d ≡ m (mod N) for all messages m, assuming m < N.
